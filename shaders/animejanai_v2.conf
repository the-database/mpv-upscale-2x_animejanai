# ===============================================================================================
# This configuration file allows setup of up to 9 slots which customize the
# AnimeJaNai VapourSynth chain. Most typically this can be used to run different models
# on different slots, but the chain is fully customizable to allow handling a variety of
# anime sources as well as a variety of hardware with different performance levels.
# The first 6 slots have been preconfigured with some suggested settings for handling various
# anime sources, but advanced users may customize the settings of any slot to suit their needs.
# The chain runs the following steps. Any step can be enabled or disabled:
# 1. Resize video.
# 2. If the video height is between 720 and 1080 at this point, resize it to 1080.
# 3. Upscale with 2x AnimeJaNai using the selected HD model if the current video height
#    is 720 or greater and the selected SD model if the current video height is below 720.
# 4. Resize video to a height of 1080.
# 5. If the video is below 3840x2160 here, upscale with 2x AnimeJaNai using the HD model
#    if the current video height is 720 or greater and the SD model if the current video
#    height is below 720.
# 6. Interpolate video frames with RIFE 4.6.
